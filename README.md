# Hello! I'm working on my own UI library ðŸ¦‹

### If you clone this, use the command yarn storybook or npm storybook to start the development

I'm currently learning about how CSS works in the course [CSS for Javascript Developers by Josh Comeau](https://css-for-js.dev/) and also following videos about Storybook in the [Guillermo Rodas](https://www.youtube.com/c/GuillermoRodas/videos) channel

Some of the things and tricks would be here in this project, I hope you found some of the code usefull!

#### For this proyect I'm currently using:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Component driven methodology](https://www.componentdriven.org/)
